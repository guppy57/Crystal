# Crystal

This is my attempt to create a blockchain network, completely from scratch. It wont be as secure, robust, or interesting as existing technologies, nor do I strive do something along those lines.

## Attempt at an Explanation
The Crystal network as a fair set of features for a variety of users and a couple different types of crystals. You can be a seller, holder, miner, or a buyer. Sellers (at any point in time) are in the business of selling thier *White* Crystals, where as buyers are looking to buy it. White Crystals are used in the main market and dont have a garunteed future of stability. Miners are working to verify transactions and are payed for thier efforts with *Blue* Crystals. These crystals are always worth a specific amount. This gives miners a reason to mine, no matter the price or speculation of White Crystals. Holders play a key role in the network, as they act to keep the economy. Holders opt to carry a specific amount of White Crystals for a specific amount of time, where they can't sell or spend it, and for thier contributions to hold White Crystals they are rewarded in *Silver* Crystals, which have the same value of Blue Crystals, but the amount they recieve are calculated by the amount of time they are willing to hold on to the White Crystals.
